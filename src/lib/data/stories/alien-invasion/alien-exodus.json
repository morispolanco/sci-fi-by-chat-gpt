They had been observing Earth for centuries, studying its inhabitants and gathering knowledge. The invasion was merely a means to an end, a way to secure vital resources for their dying planet.",
  "As the Exodus Arks set sail into the cosmos, a sense of both hope and sadness permeated the ships. Hope, because they were leaving behind the destruction and chaos of Earth.
