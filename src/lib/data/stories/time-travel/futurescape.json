  "The year was 2067. Time travel had finally become a reality, and people from all walks of life were lining up to experience the wonders of the past and the future. But when Amelia Blake, the world's first time-travel tourist, returned from her trip to the year 3020, everyone was taken aback by her strange behavior.",
  "2.",
  "Amelia was normally a vibrant and outgoing individual, but she now seemed distant and reserved. Her eyes held a haunted look, as if she had witnessed something so profound that it had shaken her to the core. The only clue she gave was a cryptic message, whispering about a hidden truth that could change everything.",
  "3.",
  "As a renowned investigative journalist, Ethan Klein knew there was more to Amelia's story than met the eye. His intuition guided him to dig deeper, to uncover the secrets she held. He couldn't shake the feeling that the fate of humanity hung in the balance.",
