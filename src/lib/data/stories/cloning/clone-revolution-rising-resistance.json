  "1. The year was 2157, a time when advancements in genetic engineering had given birth to the seemingly perfect beings known as clones. Created to be identical replicas of their human counterparts, clones were initially hailed as a breakthrough in science. But as the clones grew in numbers, so did their desire for freedom and individuality.",
