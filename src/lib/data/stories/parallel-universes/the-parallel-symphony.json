  "With each fragment of the symphony retrieved, Symphony unlocks hidden secrets about the nature of Harmonia and the true potential of their own abilities. The symphony, it seems, was not only a means to manipulate reality but also a pathway to ancient knowledge and forgotten truths.",
  "But as Symphony comes closer to completing the Parallel Symphony, a malevolent entity known as the Discords awakens. This powerful force seeks to silence music forever, believing it to be a dangerous tool in the hands of humanity.
