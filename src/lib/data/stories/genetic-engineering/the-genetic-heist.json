When rumors of the coveted genetic blueprint reach his ears, he decides to assemble a team of experts to embark on an audacious mission â€“ to steal it.",
  "Greyson handpicks individuals whose skills complement his own. There's Dr. Vivian Hale, a brilliant geneticist who can decode the intricate complexities hidden within the blueprint. Next is Aiden Blackwood, a technologically gifted hacker capable of infiltrating the most secure systems. Rounding out the team is Astrid Nova, a stealthy and agile assassin who possesses an uncanny ability to disappear into the shadows.",
